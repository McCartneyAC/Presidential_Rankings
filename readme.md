In 2014 and again in March of 2018, Brandon Rottinghaus and Justin S. Vaughn polled a group of presidential scholars, political theorists, and poli-sci researchers, professors, and academics and asked them various questions about the 44, and now 45, presidents. One of the bigly publicized products of this survey are the presidential rankings, which have recently [made news](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/19/opinion/how-does-trump-stack-up-against-the-best-and-worst-presidents.html?smid=tw-share).

[Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/presidential-ratings-are-flawed-which-makes-it-hard-to-assess-trump/) has a pretty good write up on the perils of over-interpreting the data, which I suggest you read. The purpose of this Shiny app is to allow users to explore the data a bit more than is possible in news reports and other online articles, and to see the data themselves via an interactive data table.
